# DigitalThermometer
This is a pet project. I have created a digital thermometer using Arduino NANO, DS18B20 digital temperature sensor and 1602A LCD, which measures temperature in four different scales. I.e., Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit and Réaumur.

## Features
- Measures temperature in Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit and Reaumur
- Uses Arduino NANO as the main controller
- Utilizes DS18B20 digital temperature sensor for accurate readings
- Displays temperature on 1602A LCD
- Supports temperature conversion between scales

## Construction
You can use any construction approach you like (breadboard, pcb, suspended installation, etc.).
I have used a suspended installation for prototyping and testing.
The components you'll need are as follows:
- Arduino NANO microcontroller debugging board
- DS18B20 digital temperature sensor
- 1602A LCD display
- 2 x LiIon 18650 batteries (Is very comfortable to construct with 2 18650 batteries as 2 batteries have almost the same size as 1602A LCD )
- 2 x 18650 battery holders
- Any TP4056 charger module
- Any MT3608 DC→DC Step UP module
- 1 x 300 Ohm 1/4 W 1% resistor
- 1 x 1k 1/4 W 1% resistor
- 1 x 4k7 1/4 W 1% resistor
- 1 x 100k 1/4 W 1% resistor
- Wires
- Soldering iron
- Solder
- Flux

## Device assembly
To assemble all parts appropriately, use the [Schematic](https://github.com/EugenStadnik/DigitalThermometer/blob/master/DigitalThermometerScheme.jpg).
VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure that the MT3608 DC→DC Step UP module is set to 5V mode. 
Before to solder MT3608 module to other components, connect its output to the voltmeter and screw the MT3608 module potentiometer until its output voltage is 5 V.

## Flash microcontroller
First to flash the microcontroller, you need to install the [microDS18B20](https://github.com/GyverLibs/microDS18B20) library.
Then figure out your DS18B20 digital temperature sensor unique address using following [steps](https://github.com/GyverLibs/microDS18B20?tab=readme-ov-file#%D1%87%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B0)
and edit the ```uint8_t addr[] = {0x28, 0x7F, 0xB2, 0xBF, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x65};``` variable with appropriate velue.
Use either Arduino IDE or Xgpro with any applicable T48, T56 or any other flasher.
